			<h2>
				Project Overview 
			</h2>
			<p>
				For my first project at the BYU Office of IT, I was tasked with the challenge to re-design a massive website to ensure accreditation standards, stakeholders requests, and users needs were met.  
			</p>
			<p>
				The previous application system (called mYlink) for the Educator Preparation Program at Brigham Young University was severely outdated. So much so the accreditation council demanded it be updated in order for EPP to maintain their accreditation status. 				
			</p>
			<p> <strong>Timeline:&nbsp;</strong>May 2019 - Jan 2021</p>
			<p> <strong>Hypothesis:&nbsp;</strong> My expectation as a result of this project was to assist in the design of a fresh user interface and enhanced user experience. As well as developing a new system that would meet the rigorous needs of the accreditation council.</p>
			<p> <strong>Team:&nbsp;</strong>I worked with a team of 2 UX/UI designers, 7 developers, 2 product mangers. My co-worker and I also worked closely with stakeholders from EPP to ensure we were meeting their needs. </p>
			<p> <strong>Role:&nbsp;</strong> User research, UI design, User testing</p>
			<h2>
				Research
			</h2>
			<p>
				Several pieces of data and research drove the direction of this project. Before I was hired on, the UX team conducted surveys to see what problems users faced while using mYlink. After organizing, analyzing, and synthesizing the data received, the team found several recurring themes:  
			</p>
			<ul> 
				<li>Student application process confusion</li>
				<li>Simplifying admin application creation</li>
				<li>Admin role hierarchy enhancements</li>
				<li>UI is outdated and unintuitive</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Keep in mind, this is merely a glance at the vast changes requested and made. These guided the direction of the front-end UX and UI design throughout the remainder of the project. So much so that I frequently would reference the user feedback data to ensure I was solving this problems in the best way possible. 
 
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to the vast reach of the Educator Preparation Program on campus and in the community, we conducted research interviews with end admin users from surrounding school districts. Attempting to reach all those who interacted with Educator was not possible with the time and budget restraints we were given. So we did our best to prioritize who we interviewed to meet the most essential project requirements. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After gathering the data, we used affinity mapping to categorize our findings. From here we developed a set of problem (“I”) statements that were then turned in to recommendations given to the team, along with our personas. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				Testing
			</h2>
			<p>
				Throughout the design process, we would test our prototypes and the parts of the site that had been developed at that point. We utilized surveys and in person interviews and observations. Typically, we conducted these after completing each of the 4 “transitions”. Transitions are how we organized the UX process for the web application. Seeking user feedback throughout the process was crucial and allowed us to meaningfully improve each step of the way. 

			</p>
			<h2>
				Deliverables
			</h2>
			<p>
				Our deliverables to the team consisted of user/admin research data, UX suggestions, UI prototypes, and testing results.
				Because I came into this project after it started and left before it was finished, here’s the main parts of Educator I worked on: 
			</p>
			<ul> 
				<li>Program specific application items</li>
				<li>Admin role request approval system</li>
				<li>Admin application reviewing process</li>
				<li>District field services placement coordination</li>
				<li>Program director application building process</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				Outcome
			</h2>
			<p>
				Because I did not see the end of this project through to see what the outcome was, I reached out to a stakeholder from the EPP office I worked directly with to see how Educator was working, she said:  
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“It has been a night and day difference between Educator and mYlink and I think much of that is due to the fact the you (the UX team) reached out to the users for feedback and then designed user friendly screens based on that feedback. The new design of Educator has definitely improved the experience for the users.  Educator is easier to use, navigate and understand.  The process for applying and sorting through applications is more efficient and effective.“
			</blockquote>
			<h2>
				What I learned
			</h2>
			<p>
				Processes can become very complex very quickly. This was my first “real” project as a UX/UI designer and I don’t know if I was totally qualified for what I was getting into. 	
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout the process, I learned what UX design is and how crucial it is to understand the users needs and all those who will play a role in the product. It stretched my skillset in multiple ways ultimately for the better.
