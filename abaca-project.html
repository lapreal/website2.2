			<h2>
				Project Overview 
			</h2>
			<p>
				During my internship at Village Capital, I was placed the Abaca web app team to conduct user research on social impact entrepreneurs + investors. Abaca helps social impact entrepreneurs assess where they are in their business progression and helps them move forward. It also connects entrepreneurs to social impact investors to do just that. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Abaca functions and is based off of its team members’ considerable knowledge of both investors and entrepreneurs. But in order to make solid strategy decisions, the Abaca team needs to have data about entrepreneurs and investors. In order to meet this need, we worked on: 
			</p>
			<ul> 
				<li>Conducting research on impact investors & entrepreneurs</li>
				<li>Analyzing and synthesizing the data into user personas</li>
				<li>Designing the entrepreneur’s venture readiness level detailed view</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Prior to this project, the University Relations department was required to manually search through obituaries and take calls 24/7 attempting to discover BYU employees who have passed on. Due to the archaic process of finding the deceased employees, many would fall through the cracks leaving already devastated families hurting even more.
			</p>
			<p> <strong>Timeline:&nbsp;</strong>Sept 2020-Dec 2020</p>
			<p> <strong>Hypothesis:&nbsp;</strong> To provide Village Capital’s Abaca team with useful recommendations based on research and designs that would be implemented into the product. To come out at the end with a better understanding of UX research process and methods.</p>
			<p> <strong>Team:&nbsp;</strong>I worked closely with a team of students also in the internship. This team consisted of 2 researchers, 1 designer, 1 team lead, and 1 internship director. We reported weekly to the UX research lead on the Abaca team.</p>
			<p> <strong>Role:&nbsp;</strong> UI design, graphic design, user research</p>
			<h2>
				Research
			</h2>
			<p>
				Our research phase consisted of developing research plans, creating discussion guides, utilizing explorative research, using affinity grouping, producing problem statements, and forming user personas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Our goal was to interview 10 investors and entrepreneurs. Ideally we wanted half to be familiar with the product and the other half to have no idea what Abaca was. Fortunately, we found enough investors through the Abaca database and through external connections. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We were not so lucky in finding entrepreneurs. Our deadline was fast approaching and we had not found a single entrepreneur to interview through Village Capital’s resources. I decided to take matters in my own hands and utilize my own LinkedIn network. This got us 3 impact entrepreneurs and after asking them for referrals we interviewed a total of 6. Although we did not reach our intended goal, the amount we did get would give us at least 85% of the important problems entrepreneurs face. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After gathering the data, we used affinity mapping to categorize our findings. From here we developed a set of problem (“I”) statements that were then turned in to recommendations given to the team, along with our personas. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				Deliverables
			</h2>
			<p>
				At the end of the project, we provided Abaca’s product manger with a list of recommendations based off our user research data findings. We found /Abaca’s services do meet some of the needs of the users, however we identified specific areas for improvement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In particular, we found impact entrepreneurs are not just interested in borrowing any investment, rather they want investors to be genuinely interested and engaged in the cause they are attempting to solve. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to the personas and UX recommendations, we provided several UI prototypes of the venture readiness level detailed view page which was passed on to be implemented into Abaca. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				Outcome
			</h2>
			<p>
				We learned that entrepreneurs and investors are very different types of people, ironically enough. Because of this, they tend to have trust issues with each other. While this is not an easy problem to solve, Abaca is properly equipped to tackle the challenge. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				What I learned
			</h2>
			<p>
				I learned so much about UX research I wish I had in previous projects. I learned I enjoyed the process much more than I thought I would. 	
			</p>
			<p>
				One important lesson learned was if your UX lead leaves half way through the project, it can be easy to give up and use that as an excuse for underperforming. Thankfully, my team and I decided to take the high road, get creative, and work harder to accomplish the tasks by the deadline.
